To list the pools in a Ceph cluster, you would typically use the ceph osd lspools command. Here's a breakdown and some additional context:

Basic Command:

    ceph osd lspools

This command provides a list of the pools that exist within your Ceph cluster, along with their associated pool IDs.

What are Ceph Pools?

In Ceph, pools are logical partitions that store data objects.

They define attributes like:

Replication or erasure coding: How data redundancy is handled.

Placement groups (PGs): How data is distributed across OSDs.

CRUSH rules: How data placement is determined.

Important Considerations:

Ceph Command-Line Interface (CLI):

You'll need to have the Ceph CLI tools installed and configured to run these commands.

Typically, these commands are executed on a Ceph monitor node or a node with Ceph client tools.

Alternative listing:

ceph osd pool ls this command will only list the pool names.

More information:

To get more detailed information about the pools, you can use commands like rados df or ceph osd pool stats [pool-name]. These commands will show you usage statistics and other relevant data.

In essence, ceph osd lspools is your primary tool for getting a quick overview of the pools configured within your Ceph storage cluster.


delete a pool ceph


Deleting a Ceph pool is a serious operation that results in permanent data loss. Ceph has built-in safeguards to prevent accidental deletion, so you must take specific steps. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Enable Pool Deletion:

By default, Ceph prevents pool deletion. You must first enable it by setting the mon_allow_pool_delete configuration option to true.
You can do this using the following Ceph CLI command:

    ceph config set mon mon_allow_pool_delete true

2. Delete the Pool:

Once pool deletion is enabled, you can delete the pool using the following command:

    ceph osd pool delete {pool-name} {pool-name} --yes-i-really-really-mean-it

Replace {pool-name} with the actual name of the pool you want to delete.

The pool-name is written twice, and the --yes-i-really-really-mean-it flag is required to confirm that you understand the consequences of the operation.

Important Considerations:

  + Data Loss: Deleting a pool permanently removes all data stored within it. Ensure you have backups of any critical data before proceeding.
  + Dependencies: If other Ceph components (like RADOS Gateway or RBD images) rely on the pool, deleting it can cause those components to malfunction.
  + CRUSH Rules: If the pool has custom CRUSH rules, consider deleting those rules if they are no longer needed.
  + User Permissions: If any Ceph users have permissions specifically granted for the pool, consider revoking those permissions.

Ceph Dashboard:

If you are using the Ceph dashboard, you can also delete pools through the graphical interface. However, you will still likely need to enable the mon_allow_pool_delete configuration option.

Proxmox VE:

If you are using Ceph with Proxmox VE, be extra cautious. Proxmox VE can have it's own layer of abstraction over the Ceph pools. Make sure that any storage definitions within Proxmox VE that are using the Ceph pool are removed before the Ceph pool is deleted.

Example:

To delete a pool named "my_pool," you would execute the following commands:

    ceph config set mon mon_allow_pool_delete true
    ceph osd pool delete my_pool my_pool --yes-i-really-really-mean-it

By following these steps carefully, you can safely delete Ceph pools when necessary.
